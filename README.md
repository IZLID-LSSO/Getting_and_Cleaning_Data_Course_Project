Three files are contained in the repository, their function is listed below.  

``Codebook.md`` lists all variables from the initial data set, and the analysis processes performed on the representative data.

`run_analysis.R` contains the R script to download target data, create a tidy data set, and analyze the data for means of each activity, for each study participant.

`secTidySet.txt` is the generated output of analizing the target data for means.  The output was created using the following software:  
  * `R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26)`  
  * `library(dplyr) version 0.8.1`
